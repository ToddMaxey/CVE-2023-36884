CVE-2023-36884


Here's how you can convert the registry file data into a PowerShell script:

```powershell
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION"
$names = @("Excel.exe", "Graph.exe", "MSAccess.exe", "MSPub.exe", "Powerpnt.exe", "Visio.exe", "WinProj.exe", "WinWord.exe", "Wordpad.exe")

foreach ($name in $names) {
    if (!(Test-Path -Path $registryPath)) {
        New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force | Out-Null
    }
    New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $name -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null
}
```

This script first defines the registry path and the names of the registry keys to be created. It then loops through each name, checks if the path exists, creates it if it doesn't, and then creates a new DWORD registry entry with a value of 1 for each name.

Please note that running this script requires administrative privileges because it modifies the HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) registry hive. Always be careful when modifying the Windows registry, as incorrect changes can cause system instability or other issues.
